Here is my messy flowchart. Too lazy to make a graphical flowchart.

Classes:
	Channel - Holds all the values for a channel.
	Chatting - The main class for the plugin.
	ChattingPlayerListener - Self explanitory.
	MessageFormatting - Holds methods to format strings (Get the right prefixes, channels etc.)
	
	
FlowChart for commands:

	On command:
		If command is:
			/c - Main command. Might be changed.
				Check for arguments:
					<ChannelName> - If there are only 1 argument, it will be treated as a channel name, and will then join that channel.
					leave <ChannelName>
					go IC - Will print out all following messages with IC information. Only applicable while in IC channels.
					go OOC - Opposite of above.

On enable:
	Load .xml files into an ArrayList/HashMap
	Check if Characterization-ing is installed.
	Register events (PLAYER_CHAT, PLAYER_COMMAND, PLAYER_LOGIN, PLAYER_QUIT)

Channels:
	Will be defined in an xml file. Will contain a constructor, which automatically loads all the values from a file.
	Values to be held:
		String name; - Name of channel
		int range; - Range in blocks. 0 for Global channel.
		boolean rpState; - True if the channel is IC-focused.
